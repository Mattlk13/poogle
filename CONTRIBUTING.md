## Pull requests

Pull requests (PR) are very welcomed but please follow these few rules for project sake and for you to not have bad surprises.

### Workflow

You must follow **[Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)**. You may be asked to squash useless commit for project visibility.

### Working with issues

You are not forced to open an issue to make a pull request. But you should. Issues provides us an easy way
of tracking evolutions and progress. It also avoid that people work on the same exact feature while they
could do something more useful. So please fill an issue before starting developping a substantial feature.

### Code quality

Your PR must provide quality insurance. Especially it must :

* Follow code guideline (tslint + airbnb)
* Not decrease (significantly) code quality indicators (like code coverage or maintenability score)

It would also be nice if you include Quality Assurance (QA) notes on your PR.
