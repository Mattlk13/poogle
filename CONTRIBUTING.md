# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via
[email](mailto:poogle+features@protonmail.com), issue, or any other method with the owners
before making a change.

Please don't open an issue to ask a very simple question, prefer email or any more "direct"
debate method if you know the maintainer.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), you **must** follow it in all your interactions
with the project.

## Pull requests

Pull requests (PR) are very welcomed but please follow these few rules for project sake and for you to not have bad
surprises.

### Workflow

You must follow **[Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)**.
An exception we require from Github flow is that you may not want to commit every file change.
Commit when you think it is pertinent. You may be asked to squash useless commit for project visibility.

### Working with issues

You are not forced to open an issue to make a pull request. But you might. Issues provides us an easy way
of tracking evolutions and progress. It also avoid that people work on the same exact feature while they
could do something more useful. So please fill an issue before starting developping a substantial feature.

### Code quality

Your PR must provide quality insurance. Especially it must :

* Follow code guideline (tslint + airbnb)
* Not decrease (significantly) code quality indicators (like code coverage)

It would also be nice if you include Quality Assurance (QA) notes on your PR.
